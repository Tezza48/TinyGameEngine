# TinyEngine

TinyEngine is a single header game engine implementation project inspired by the OLC Game engines.

New Thing: Cameras and materials!

Next up is either textures, propper blinn-phong lighting or shadows.

## Note:
The default shaders are currently separate from the header but will eventually be bundled into it in some form so that you only need one header for the engine to work.
